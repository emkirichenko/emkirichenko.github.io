Welcome to my blog about scientific etymology and medical terminology! This space will feature posts exploring the fascinating linguistic history behind scientific and medical terms.

## What to Expect

I'm currently developing content for this blog, with the first posts planned for **August 2025**.

### Upcoming Post Topics

**Etymology Deep Dives**

**Language Analysis**

## My Background

As a student pursuing a **Certificate in Languages of Medicine and Health** alongside my Biology & Psychology degree, I'm passionate about:
- The intersection of linguistics and science
- How understanding etymology enhances scientific learning
- Making complex terminology accessible through historical context
- Multilingual approaches to medical education

## Stay Tuned

This blog will launch in **August 2025** following consultations with my medical terminology professor. Each post will combine rigorous etymological research with engaging storytelling to make the history of scientific language accessible and interesting.
