## Computational Neuroscience Research

This section will showcase projects involving:

### Planned Research Areas
- **Neural Network Modeling:** Computational models of neural processes
- **Neuroimaging Analysis:** MATLAB/Python applications for brain imaging data  
- **Biomarker Discovery:** Machine learning approaches to neurological disease detection

### Current Preparation
- **BIO 3IR3:** Independent research project (planned for 2026)
- **MATLAB Development:** Building skills for neuroimaging applications
- **PNB 3A03:** Neuroimaging coursework (Fall 2025)

*This section will be updated with actual research projects as I complete my independent study and advance toward graduate research.*
