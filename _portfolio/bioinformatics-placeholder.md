- **Genomic Data Analysis:** Python/R applications for biological datasets
- **Protein Structure Analysis:** Computational approaches to molecular biology
- **Statistical Genomics:** Advanced statistical methods for biological research

### Technical Foundation
- **Python:** Data manipulation with Pandas, NumPy
- **R:** Statistical analysis and bioinformatics packages
- **Laboratory Skills:** PCR, gel electrophoresis, analytical chemistry

*Projects will be added as I develop expertise through coursework and research opportunities.*
