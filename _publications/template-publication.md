## Future Research Directions

As an undergraduate student preparing for graduate studies, I am developing research projects in:

### Primary Research Interests
- **Computational Neuroscience:** Developing models for understanding neural processes
- **Neurodegeneration Research:** Investigating biomarkers for early disease detection  
- **Neuroimmunology:** Exploring immune system interactions in neurological disorders

### Current Preparation
- **Independent Research Project (BIO 3IR3):** Planning research in computational neuroscience
- **Technical Skills Development:** Building proficiency in Python, R, and MATLAB for data analysis
- **Academic Foundation:** Completing coursework in immunology, virology, and neuroimaging

### Research Goals
This section will be updated with actual publications as I complete my independent research project and progress toward graduate studies in neuroscience.
