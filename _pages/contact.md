## Get in Touch

I'm always interested in discussing research opportunities, neuroscience, scientific etymology, or academic collaborations.

### Academic Contact

**Email:** [kiriche@mcmaster.ca](mailto:kiriche@mcmaster.ca)  
**Institution:** McMaster University  
**Location:** Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

### Research Interests

Feel free to reach out if you're working on or interested in:
- Computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics
- Neurodegeneration and neuroimmunology research
- Biomarker discovery for neurological disorders  
- Scientific etymology and medical terminology
- Undergraduate research opportunities
- Graduate school collaboration

### Programming & Technical Projects

**GitHub:** [github.com/emkirichenko](https://github.com/emkirichenko)

I enjoy discussing programming applications in biological research, particularly:
- Python for data analysis and computational modelling
