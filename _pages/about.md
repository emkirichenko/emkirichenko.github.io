# Welcome

I'm Emily Kirichenko, a third-year student in the Combined Honours Biology & PNB (Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour) program at McMaster University with a strong interest in neuroscience and immunology research.

## Academic Background

Currently pursuing a **Combined Honours degree in Biology and Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour** with an expected graduation in April 2027. I maintain a cumulative GPA of 10.0/12.0 and have been recognised on the Dean's Honour List.

I am also completing a **Concurrent Certificate in Languages of Medicine and Health**, to deepend my understanding and appreciation for scientific etymology and Lain.

## Research Interests

My primary research interests include:

- **Computational Neuroscience & Neuroinformatics:** Developing computational models to understand neural processes and brain function
- **Neurodegeneration & Neuroimmunology:** Investigating diseases such as MS, ALS, and Alzheimer's disease, particularly focusing on immune system interactions
- **Biomarker Discovery:** Working toward improved therapies and diagnostic methods as well early detection for neurological disorders
- **Scientific Etymology:** Exploring the historical development and linguistic evolution of medical terminology

## Technical Skills & Development

I'm actively developing programming and analytical skills essential for modern neuroscience research:

- **Programming Languages:** Python (proficient), R (developing), MATLAB (developing)
- **Laboratory Techniques:** PCR, gel electrophoresis, microscopy, analytical chemistry methods
- **Data Analysis:** Statistical methods, data visualisation, research methodology
- **Languages:** Fluent in English, Russian, and Hebrew

## Current Academic Focus

**Fall 2025 Coursework:**
- BIOLOGY 3P03: Cell Physiology
- HTHSCI 3I03: Introduction to Immunology  
- HTHSCI 3K03: Principles of Virology
- PNB 3A03: Neuroimaging
- PNB 3XE3: Inferential Statistics & Research Methods

## Looking Forward

I'm currently preparing for independent research opportunities through BIO 3IR3 and planning for graduate studies in neuroscience. My goal is to contribute to the understanding of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system through computational approaches and biomarker research.

Beyond academics, I'm passionate about linguistics, video-gaming, and reading.
